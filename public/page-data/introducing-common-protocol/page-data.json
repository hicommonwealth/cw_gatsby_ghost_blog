We know things need to change.\n\nChange starts by funding a new generation of ideas, projects, and communities\nthat can grow into real solutions. Yet, if funding these projects were left to\ntraditional gatekeepers—private funds, foundations, universities, and\ngovernments, we’d get more of the same--opaque decision-making, slow processes\nand uninspiring ideas.\n\nCrowdfunding was presented as an alternative, and while the crowd is large, it\ncan be fickle, making project funding less sustainable. Beyond that, experts\naren’t incentivized to lend credibility to projects on these platforms. And,\neven when platforms do succeed, they risk becoming yet another gatekeeper, owned\nby the few, leaving out scientists and artists championing progress.\n\nThat’s not to say that crowdfunding doesn’t work. After all, billions of dollars\nof creative projects have been funded. Yet, early projects just need more than\nmoney; they need credibility and community these platforms aren’t built to give.\nToday, an endorsement by an influencer is all you need to start to bootstrap a\nthriving community.\n\nWith this in mind, we’re announcing Common Protocol, a new way to\ncollaboratively fund and organize around impactful token projects.\n\nThe Common Protocol\nCommon Protocol is a protocol for communities to collaborate and crowdfund for\nany interest-group or protocol token. Common lets anyone start or back projects.\nWhile being open, Common allows projects to gain credibility by letting curators\nrecognize projects and new talent. Curators are artists and scientists who\nindependently “stake” on projects, using their existing network and knowledge to\nincrease the chance of finding success. Finally, ideas are set up for long-term\nsustainability by creating collectives which act like endowments.\n\nCommon is built using composable smart contracts. Because everything is “default\nopen” and stored on chain, it’s easy for any backer or curator to track every\ntransaction showing how funds are used. Beyond that, ownership of Common\nProtocol can be shared based on fair, community governed rewards ensures that\nthe majority of rewards and fees go to users, not the platform itself.\n\nCreating Projects\nProjects can be anything--a request for a team to fulfill an unmet need or a\nfocused team on a world changing idea. Using Common, like on Kickstarter,\nproject creators choose:\n\n * Fundraising goal\n * Accepted currencies or tokens\n * Deadline (if any)\n * Backer rewards (optional): a reward, like a token, for people who back the\n   project\n * Curator reward (optional): a portion % of the total amount raised that goes\n   to curators.\n * Carry: a portion of the interest accrued to be used by the project or\n   collective.\n\nAs backers deposit into a project, they receive a “backer token”. The token\ngives them some oversight on the spending of funds, a claim on the curator’s\nstaked tokens if the project funding isn’t reached, and a claim on potential\nbacker rewards. The deposits from both curators and backers earn interest by\nbeing lent to safe, interest-earning protocols, like Yearn or Aave.\n\nCurating Ideas\nCurators demonstrate skin-in-the-game by staking token on projects they like,\nmultiple curators are able to stake on a project simultaneously. As curators\ndeposit into a project, they receive a “curator token”, giving them the claim on\nthe curator reward. With Common, rewards first go to curators, unlike\ntraditional platform which take the majority for setting initial ground rules.\n\nBy staking, curators make all parties better off. If funding is successful,\nbackers get the project they wanted, curators get the curator reward set (% of\nthe total raise) , and projects get to the rest. If funding fails, backers get\nthe curators stake, curators lose their stake, and backers are no worse off.\n\nRunning Collectives\nProjects building for the common good often have trouble raising capital,\nespecially hard for technical projects like a smart contract audit or research.\nThe lack of funding leads artists and scientists on the continual chase for\nfunding, distracting them from the act of creation.\n\nCommon solves this by letting individuals and communities create collectives.\nCollectives are started like projects. Instead of using all funds in one shot,\ntokens that backers deposit continually earn interest. Only the interest earned\nis able to be used without a backer vote. This gives collectives a source of\ntransparent, sustainable funding similar to an endowment. Collectives can still\nchoose to allow curators to stake, while collectives don’t have a hard deadline,\ncurators can still earn a portion of accrued interest.\n\nCollectives can also use deposits to curate other projects on Common and\nparticipate in protocol decisions of other protocols.\n\nOwning Common\nThe Common Protocol is initially coupled towards protocols with an existing\ntoken however over time. In general, it’s important that Common is not just\ncontrolled by institutions or the few. We need to make sure that while the early\nbackers, curators, and project creators are left out of ownership. As new\nprojects get funded and new communities are created via Common, everyone can and\nshould earns more of Common—backers, curators, and projects are slowly rewarded\nwith more ownership. Common holders have a few key superpowers. Holders can vote\nto allocate a community pool of tokens, providing new community features,\nenhancements to the core protocol.\n\nOver time, holders will also have the ability to create new “sub” communities by\nstaking Common to create a community coin. Each community will be able to\n\nSeeding Crypto\nWhile Common can work for any type of project, it’s first being proved in\ncrypto. The crypto community is particularly open to experimentation and has key\ncases that could be improved by creating projects or collectives:\n\n * Crowdfunding Audits. Contract and economic vulnerabilities have led to over\n   $50m lost in just the past few weeks. Yet, some teams are forgoing audits to\n   launch quickly. The process could remain lean, if audits are crowdfunded as\n   projects launch. Team can put up a bounty, rewarding users for chipping in a\n   few dollars, and giving everyone peace of mind. Finding vulnerabilities will\n   only become more critical as DeFi scales to billions of dollars.\n * Creating Power Pools. Projects are allowing token-holding users to influence\n   decisions through votes. Developers or governance delegates can create\n   collectives, only accepting certain tokens. This collective can then work to\n   positively influence the network, using any earned interest to fund projects\n   to help grow the underlying tokens.\n * Creating Community Funds for Social Tokens, New Projects, and NFT Art. Tokens\n   like $ALEX or $FWB do a great job of coordinating like-minded people, however\n   it often ends there. By creating a collective and only accepting $ALEX or \n   $FWB [https://fwb.help/], individuals can fund projects together.\n * Bounties, Developer Tooling, and Research. Over $10b raised by teams whose\n   purpose depends on an ecosystem of tools. These wallets, user interfaces, and\n   even researchers often don’t have sustainable business models. Instead,\n   projects themselves can become contributors. For example, Synthetix and\n   Polkadot can allocate their $300m+ treasuries to a collective or project to\n   fund useful tooling, common infrastructure, and small bounties useful for\n   projects. Gitcoin is already doing this on a small scale.\n\nMoreover, crypto users will be the first to be able to back the Common\ncollective, depositing tokens to earn ownership in Common. The deposited tokens\nwill earn interest allowing Common to run sustainably, and in other protocol\ngovernance when available.\n\nOur Journey\nCollaborative funding through Common Protocol is only one part of our mission to\nhelp communities work better together. Towards this end, we’re leveraging\ninfrastructure we’ve built over the past two years—the Commonwealth Client and\nthe Edgeware Blockchain.\n\nCommon Protocol only deepens the engagement already made possible through the\ninterface where some $350m worth of blockchain communities discuss topics,\nmanage funds, and vote on issues. Using the interface, community members will be\nable to seamlessly create crowdfunded ideas or propose collectives, gaining\nexposure to others active in their community and elsewhere on the platform, and\nstake tokens to earn ownership of Common.\n\nCommon Protocol is built on Edgeware, the community-owned blockchain we helped\nlaunch. The Edgeware community was seeded in a crowdfunding-like campaign, the\nlockdrop. People from around the world locked over 1.2m ETH ($500m) to earn\nnetwork tokens. Today, Edgeware is worth ~$50m with a core community of artists,\ndevelopers, governance experiments working daily to make the project an\ninteresting place for new users. Through network partners, some 10m users will\ngain access to Edgeware over the next year, and we’re lucky enough to launch\nCommon Protocol to this growing ecosystem.\n\nHowever, Commonwealth Protocol isn’t just limited to Edgeware. It’ll be\nmulti-chain allowing all projects to take advantage of the project. By being\nopen-source and built on-chain, developers will be able to bring Common projects\nand collectives to Telegram, Discord, and Slack wherever existing communities\nare.\n\nFrom Crypto to Everything Else\nFrom here, Commonwealth will expand to fund real-world public goods including \nmetascience, climate research, new token networks, and creative and artistic\nprojects.\n\nTo bootstrap funding of project categories, tokens will be dropped to people\nwith social proofs of work. For example, those who are able to login with a\nvalid .edu email address, publish a preprint on Arxiv, or creators and artists\nwith accounts on Audius or Patreon. With a stake in ownership they can start to\ncurate new projects and ideas, helping direct the flow of funds into worthy\nprojects.\n\nAs Common continues to scale, gatekeepers will be turned into curators. When\naccess to social capital--from gatekeepers and independents--and financial\ncapital--private sources and small backers--is opened, we have a better shot of\nputting it in the hands of those who should be funded.","html":"<p>by Dillon Chen, Co-Founder &amp; CEO</p><h3 id=\"we-are-here\">We are Here</h3><p>We know things are broken.
