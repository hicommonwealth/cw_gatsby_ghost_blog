One of the popular blockchain ideas\nis the use of decentralized autonomous organizations. This article will discuss\nwhat decentralized autonomous organizations actually are, the upsides and\ndownsides of them, how they are being used today, and some potential future use\ncases. \n\n\nWhat is a DAO?\n\nA Decentralized Autonomous Organization (or DAO for short) is an organization\nrun without the control of a central authority. Instead, DAOs leverage\nblockchain technology to execute a fully autonomous organization by replacing\nthe central authority with community input. An example of a central authority is\na stock exchange like the NYSE or a stock trading app like Robinhood. In a\ncentralized organization like Robinhood, they have the power to potentially\nblock or freeze the activities of their users. In a DAO this is not possible\nbecause a central authority holds no final say or decision making power.  This\nshift in control gives the community that is surrounding the organization the\nability to make key decisions in governance and how the organization’s resources\nare managed. The decision making structure and processes are done by leveraging\nblockchain technology. Through the use of this tech, self-executing code is\ncreated in a fully transparent setting. This code adheres to a set of\norganization rules and comes with a full history of activities that it has\ncarried out.\n\n\nInstead of a hierarchical structure like in the traditional for-profit financial\nsector where decision making power is given to a select few, all members of the\ncommunity in a DAO have decision making authority. DAOs use economic mechanisms\nto align community members towards a common goal usually through the use of\nincentives that are tied to the consensus rules written into the DAO’s source\ncode. \n\n\nIn summary, DAOs allow individuals and groups to collaborate towards a common\ngoal without having to trust each other and without having to rely on a central\nauthority. \n\n\nUpsides of DAOs\nHolistic Value Creation\n\nThe idea of a DAO is to allow for a more holistic approach on value being added.\nInstead of the organization strictly working towards the financial gain of its\nusers, DAOs are able to work towards attaining other types of value relating to\nthe environment, a sense of community, and sustainability. This is done by\nmanagement becoming a facilitator of the community’s activities rather than a\ngatekeeper like in traditional organizations. \n\n\nGlobal Benefits\n\nInstead of adhering to traditional financial and legal institutions, DAOs\noperate on blockchain parameters meaning they can be almost instantaneously\ncreated without much friction. This creates a lower barrier to entry for both\ncommunities and people making a DAO. Since they operate on internet native\nblockchain technology, DAOs are not restricted by international borders either.\nThis means job and other value creation can be easily accessible globally.\n\n\nThis lack of restrictions that both traditional institutions and international\nborders have makes DAOs more accessible than legacy organizations. \n\n\nPotential Issues of DAOs\nLegal Issues\n\nDAOs have not been around for a very long time and are still very much in a\ndevelopment and discovery phase. Therefore, the legal jurisdictions that DAOs\nfall under are still yet to be determined by anyone internationally. This may\npresent a challenge as the presence of DAOs inevitably grows. \n\n\nMalicious Use Cases\n\nDAOs have the desirable qualities of being trustless, immutable, and\ndecentralized. These qualities are appealing to everyone including parties that\nwish to perform malicious activities. The scope of how malicious activities\naffect DAOs both on the management side and in the community is another aspect\nof DAOs yet to be discovered since they are so new. \n\n\nExamples of DAOs\nDash\n\nDash [https://www.dash.org/] is a DAO and also an open-source, peer-to-peer\ncryptocurrency. Dash allows for instant payments and transactions for both\nindividuals and businesses at a fraction of the cost of similar but more\ntraditional solutions. You can use Dash for almost any transaction including\nbuying coffee and paying for business services. \n\n\nMoloch DAO\n\n\nMoloch DAO [https://dao.molochdao.com/] was created for the purpose of providing\ngrants to improve the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. This DAO is essentially a\ndecentralized and equity-free venture capital organization operating in the\nEthereum blockchain ecosystem. This means that funding is dispersed according to\nwhat a good chunk of the Ethereum community actually wants instead of what a\nselect few venture capitalists want. This community decision making also\nincreases the odds of the project being successful within that same community. \n\nDAO Governance & Common Protocol\nHow community members manage the activities and resource allocation of a DAO is\nthrough governance processes. In a decentralized setting, the main governance\nactivities are a member sending in a proposal of a change that they’d like to\nsee and then other community members voting on if they want to see that change\nmade or not. Long form discussions are held within the community to better\nunderstand what the proposal entails and how the DAO (and in turn the community)\nwill benefit. Other processes that are community managed include hiring, bug\nfixing, and building new features\n\n\nDAO Governance Barriers\n\nFacilitating the governance of a decentralized organization in a way that’s\naccessible to all members of the surrounding community is a complex and\ndifficult task. Since DAOs are relatively new, facilitating their governance has\nnot always been easy and sometimes means trying to get the community to\nparticipate on 3 or more separate platforms that don’t even have all the\ncapabilities that the DAO needs to be properly governed. The Common platform\n[https://commonwealth.im/] brings all of the necessary governance tools that\nDAOs use into one platform in a crypto-Reddit like setting while being\nintegrated into on-chain events. All of the activities done on Commonwealth are\nopen by default, done completely transparently, and allow community members to\nmanage capital associated with the DAO. For a DAO, this all-in-one tool that has\nthese default-open characteristics is not just nice to have but is essential for\nproper governance.\n\n\nFuture DAO Possibilities\nWe are really just starting to understand the full potential of what DAOs can\ncontribute to society. The fluidity and flexibility that DAOs provide also allow\nfor rapid testing of different structures and voting mechanisms. There are tons\nof possibilities for DAOs that have yet to be tried out.\n\nWe could see DAOs almost merge together and work in conjunction with each other\nin the near future. An example of this is meta-governance where a DAO votes on a\nnumber of different other DAOs and sub-protocols. DAOs can also create an equal\nplaying field for all participants by making every community member anonymous. \n\n\nAnother cool use case of a DAO could be managing an e-sports or sports\norganization where a community replaces the owner role on the team. This could\nmake for some interesting player, coach, and GM hiring decisions.\n\n\nThere are a ton of valuable use cases of DAOs that are yet to be uncovered.\n\n\nTeam Contributor to this post: Rhys Hillier","html":"<p></p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>The adoption of blockchain technology globally has created a lot of important advancements in both the technology itself and the social structures that make up the ecosystem surrounding the technology.
