The AMA session started with an\nintroduction from the CEO of Commonwealth Labs, Dillon Chen. \n\n\nDillon: \"I’m Dillon, founder of Commonwealth. I got into crypto in 2013, when I\ngot my first Bitcoin. From there, Commonwealth started in 2018, where our\nprojects have raised $20m. Our main focus now is that we’re building an\nintegrated multi chain-governance, discussions, and crowdfunding protocol called \nhttps://commonwealth.im. I’ve been a trader, investor, and dorm room miner in\ncrypto, really great to watch the whole industry grow.\n\n\nWould you like to share a bit more about Common Protocol and the partnership\nwith Crust Network?\nDillon: Yea! So we’re really excited to be integrating this great Crust\nCommunity into the Commonwealth Interface, as one of the premier Substrate\nProjects. Basically the Crust community will be able to have an integrated place\nto chat long form, vote on governance, and fund treasury proposals. You can see\nthe latest at https://commonwealth.im/crust , upon completion,  expect it to\nlook like this: https://commonwealth.im/hydradx \n\n\nYouan, can you briefly introduce Crust on your end? When were you established\nand what stage have you developed to now?\nYouan: Crust Network is a decentralized storage application developed based on\nthe Polkadot Substrate framework, we provide an incentive layer for IPFS storage\nnodes. Compared with many other blockchain applications, our functions are\neasier for everyone to understand. Everyone should have used various cloud\nproducts. Crust and these cloud products provide similar services. Users can use\nCrust to store their own files and communicate with others. Crust transfer\nfiles, our users can be individuals, companies, organizations.\n\nSo how are we different from traditional cloud vendors? Traditional cloud\nvendors have their own large centralized computer center to store data centrally\nfor users. Crust is more like a form of \"sharing economy\". We do not provide\nstorage space. The storage space is provided by Crust nodes. The Crust public\nchain builds a bridge between nodes and users, and is responsible for scheduling\nusers' storage orders to nodes. Then pay salaries to the nodes. As a result,\nusers' files are \"distributed\" and stored on nodes all over the world, rather\nthan being controlled centrally. In addition to security, distributed storage\ncan also bring users a lower price.\n\nOur team was established in 2018. After two years of development and testing,\nthe first phase of the test network was officially deployed on November 30 last\nyear. On February 4 this year, we launched the Maxwell preview network, which\nintegrates almost all functions of the future main network, including node\nmining and guarantor pledge. So far, the total capacity of Maxwell's entire\nnetwork has reached 638PB. A work progress that we are very proud of is that on\nFebruary 28, Crust officially opened the storage function, which means that all\nusers can now use Maxwell network storage and transfer their files.\n\nOur mainnet is expected to go live after the Polkadot slot is captured.\n\n\nBesides as a governance platform, how else would the Common Protocol be useful\nfor Crust?\nDillon: So, in general, as long as we've been in crypto, we’ve found it really\nhard for people to get involved in governance. This came up for multiple\nreasons:\n\n\n1) the conversation was fragmented across chat apps and more\n\n2) voting was a pain (and still is)\n\n3) information across all these protocols are spread across a few different\napplications\n\n\nWe bring everything together into one place, similar to a “crypto-Reddit” for\nevery single token community that you’re a part of. Even before projects get\nstarted, they can create a project, and then they can crowdfund directly thru\nthe interface\n\nBeyond the features named above, there’s some easy-to-use things in the\npipeline.\n\n\n1) on-chain and in app notification\n\n2) mobile app to stay updated with all notifications\n\n3) and the last plans for the Common Protocol to decentralize and allow people\nto run the platform.\n\n\nTldr we want to make the product itself into something people want to use every\nday, similar to Telegram or Twitter: if you want to hop in \nhttps://t.me/HiCommonwealth (just started) you can give us any product\nrecommendation for https://commonwealth.im.\n\n\nWhat are some practical examples of Crust storage? How do you plan to promote\nthe implementation of the application?\nYouan: I guess some audience may wonder, is Crust really as easy to use as I\nsaid? Is it really one of the few storage and useable applications on the\nstorage track? We borrowed from Filecoin to provide incentives for IPFS storage\nnodes, but chose a more efficient TEE proof method. At the same time, we also\nborrowed from Polkadot's NPOS economic model and added the role of guarantor. I\nwon’t repeat the specific details here. If you are interested, please follow us\non Twitter or join our community.\n\nSo what are the examples of Crust actually being utilized? Now, well-known\nprojects such as Uniswap, Sushiswap, Compound, and MakerDAO that you frequently\nvisit have begun to use Crust to deploy their own Dapp applications; the NFT\nassets you purchase may also be stored on the Crust network; you can use Decoo\n[https://decoo.io/](a file transfer application based on Crust netwok) to easily\nupload and share your files; you can also browse your favorite videos on Socbay\n[https://socbay.io/] (a video site based on Crust network).\n\nWe have also established Crust Grants to encourage developers to develop more\nfriendly and convenient To C applications based on the Crust storage layer. We\nwill give developers a reward of up to $30,000.\n\n\nIn fact, Crust has only opened storage functions for three months, but many\necological applications have already landed. Of course, we still need a lot of\npolishing, and we have been working hard toward evangelizing decentralized\nstorage.\n\n\nFinal question - can you give us a sneak peek of what events are coming up in\nCommon Protocol that we should be keeping an eye on?\n\n\nDillon: So we’re gonna be launching 3 major product releases over the next few\nmonths. \n\n1): self serve creation for forums\n\n2): full crowdfunding protocol\n\n3): and some cool swag ($ALLS, our equivalent of $SOCKS)\n\n\nYouan: Our \"Profit Data\" campaign will be officially launched on June 22. Users\nonly need to use Crust to store files, and the system will generate data\ncomputing power for the files. You can get CRU rewards by staking CSM on the\ndata computing power. Each TB of data computing power can pledge up to 10,000\nCSM. In this event, we will issue a total of 54,000 CRUs to users, and the event\nwill last for 180 days.\n\n\nSimilar to the GPOS economic model of the Maxwell network, the CSM is pledged\nfor data computing power. Users can pledge for themselves or help others to\nshare rewards.\n\nTo participate in this event, you first need to register a Crust Maxwell account\nto create a storage order. In addition, you also need to prepare about 0.1 CRU\nfor the cost of placing an order. We provide a certain amount of free storage\nspace, you only need to have a Github account registered for more than half a\nyear, and then apply through the official website\n[https://crustnetwork.medium.com/participate-in-crust-events-earn-csm-298b62db5b16]\n.\n\n\nThank you all for joining this AMA - make sure to join @hicommonwealth on\nTelegram here: https://t.me/HiCommonwealth and follow us on Twitter: \nhttps://twitter.com/hicommonwealth to stay up to date on everything we’re\nworking on, including a future token launch. :-)","html":"<p><em>Following the announcement of our exciting partnership with Crust Network, both communities tuned in for an exciting AMA session with Commonwealth Labs’ CEO Dillon Chen, and Crust Network’s Global Branding Head, Youan Zang. </em></p><p>This much anticipated AMA session was focused on the recent partnership between both communities – the start of a series of partnerships dedicated to expanding the Common Protocol ecosystem.<br></p><p>The partnership between both communities is summarized as follows: <em>\"Common Protocol will enrich the function of Crust community government,\" said Steve from Crust Networks, \"while Crust will provide storage solutions for the Off-Chain data storage feature.\"</em><br></p><p>Here's how it all went down on the 21st of June, hosted on the Crust Network Telegram group with over 45k members.
