Participating investors and angels include\nFramework, Hashed, IDEO, Nascent, and Balaji Srinivasan. Commonwealth Labs\nincubated Common Protocol and will remain active members of the community.\n\nCommon Protocol includes an integrated client which is a community hub for token\nholders. Each tokenized community features a Reddit-like discussion board.\nAdditional functionality includes on-chain functionality like viewing key\nstakeholders, governance, and crowdfunding for both new tokens and community\ninitiatives.\n\nSantiago Santos, Partner at ParaFi capital describes the integrated community\nexperience as, \"Active, representative governance discussions with\nhigh-participation are paramount to the success of protocols and their efforts\nto build strong communities. Without it, protocols run the risk of centralized\necho chambers. As active governance participants across DeFi, we've found it\nhard at times to keep tabs on the ever-expanding number of discussions and\nproposals across our portfolio. Enter Common Protocol—a governance aggregator to\nmonitor and manage proposals from one simple interface. We're excited to back\nthe team and use the client to boost our governance capabilities.\"\n\nCommon Protocol already powers $5b+ of protocol communities in Ethereum, Cosmos,\nand the Substrate Ecosystem. The waitlist for integrations includes notable\nprojects like: AAVE, Opyn, Osmosis, Marlin, Injective Protocol, SportX,\nShowtime, Terra, Clover Finance, HydraDX, Kylin, Anchor, and Mirror Protocol.\nMany of the founders on the waitlist are also investors in the round.\n\n\"Our goal is to become the place for token communities to launch, discuss, and\ngrow in common. To accomplish this we’re building a multi-chain community\nplatform that any EVM, Substrate, and Cosmos compatible protocols or tokens can\nuse\" said Dillon Chen, founder of Common Protocol.\n\nThe team behind Commonwealth Labs and the Common Protocol previously created\nEdgeware, a smart contract platform for building decentralized applications\n(dApps) that intends to operate within the Polkadot ecosystem. As of {day of\nannouncement}, the coin market cap of EDG, its token, is {~$255M}.\n\nWith funding in hand, Common Protocol plans to make new hires to accelerate\nproduct and protocol development. One of the major features the Common Protocol\nwill offer is cross-chain protocol governance and crowdfunding for any token\ncommunity. This allows projects to use Common to crowdfund key community\ninitiatives like initial liquidity, development grants, and audits.\n\nCommon Protocol earns value via three main use-cases:\n\n 1. Projects: Kickstarter-like campaigns\n 2. Collectives: AngelList-like rolling funds\n 3. Governance: crypto native Discourse with integrated voting\n\nTime spent with the Common Protocol client drives discussion. Each discussion is\na crowdfunding opportunity. As the market cap of tokens on the Common Protocol\nclient increases, more value can be staked in collectives (aka funds).\n\n\"Despite the immense growth in assets managed by DAOs and the complexity of\noperations these DAOs manage, the tooling for them is still stuck in the stone\nage. Solutions are fragmented, home brewed, and opaque. Having participated in\nmany protocols' governance processes, I've personally felt these pains very\nacutely. Common Protocol is true next-generation software for managing these\ncommunities and will be essential for any DAO of any size to fundraise,\norganize, and scale-up. We can't be more excited to be supporting the team and\nlook forward to working with them to build the future of DAO management\" said\nTom Schmidt, Partner at Dragonfly Capital.\n\nWhen asked about Common Protocol's inspiration, Chen said, “As every interest\ngets tokenized into an ERC20 or NFT, your on-chain address becomes a link to\nyour on-chain profile. Common Protocol can help this users who are linked\non-chain collaborate and make decisions using the same default-open primitives\nwe’ve built for discussion, funding, and group coordination.”\n\nThe seed round brings Common Protocol's total capital raised to date to $3.2\nmillion. Chen declined to comment on the valuation.\n\nFor projects or individuals interested in learning more about the Common\nProtocol or Client, they can visit https://commonwealth.im, join the telegram\ngroup: https://t.me/HiCommonwealth or follow on Twitter: \nhttps://twitter.com/hicommonwealth","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://commonwealth.ghost.io/content/images/2021/06/Headar_2048w-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"810\" srcset=\"https://commonwealth.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/Headar_2048w-2.png 600w, https://commonwealth.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/06/Headar_2048w-2.png 1000w, https://commonwealth.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/06/Headar_2048w-2.png 1600w, https://commonwealth.ghost.io/content/images/2021/06/Headar_2048w-2.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h3 id=\"developers-of-common-protocol-raise-32mm-led-by-dragonfly-and-parafi-to-build-a-community-for-token-holders\">Developers of Common Protocol raise $3.2MM led by Dragonfly and Parafi to build a community for token holders</h3><p>Common Protocol raises $3.2MM led by <a href=\"https://www.dcp.capital/\">Dragonfly</a> and <a href=\"https://www.parafi.capital/\">Parafi</a>.
