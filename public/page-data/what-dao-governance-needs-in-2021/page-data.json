How well the community is aligned\nand organized is completely dependent on the capabilities of the DAO’s\ngovernance platform — if you're new to DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous\nOrganizations), check out our intro blog post on the topic here\n[https://blog.commonwealth.im/common-protocol-dao-governance/]. DAO governance\nis constantly being innovated and developed further making it difficult to\nfigure out what functionalities work best for any given individual DAO. In this\narticle we will discuss what functionalities that a DAO’s governance platform\nneeds in 2021 to properly facilitate growth and innovation within its community. \n\n\nKey Functionalities\n\nThe functionality that the governance platform provides it’s community is one of\nthe most important aspects of a DAO. Giving a DAO’s community as much governance\ncapabilities as possible will facilitate more innovative ideas and growth\nopportunities from that community. The functionality of a DAO’s governance\nplatform can either facilitate growth opportunities by having full governance\ncapabilities or stunt growth by limiting the community with an incomplete or\nfragmented platform. \n\nOffering a complete governance platform to its community should be one of a\nDAO’s top priorities from the very beginning of its inception. Below are the\nqualities that make a DAO governance platform complete in 2021. \n\n\nProposal publishing\n\nOne of the necessities that a DAO needs to have is providing its community with\nthe ability to make proposals. The structure and process of how community\nmembers publish proposals is dependent on the makeup of the DAO that they are a\npart of. If a DAO has a large and active governance community, the best practice\nis to restrict proposal publishing privileges to members with a certain amount\nof governance token owned. If the DAO has a relatively small number of active\ncommunity members it is best to allow anyone to publish a proposal so as to not\nrestrict the little activity that is occurring.\n\nCompound DAO [https://compound.finance/governance] takes a somewhat hybrid\napproach with their innovative proposal structure that combines the positives\nfrom both of the aforementioned options. A community member is required to have\na significant amount of the Compound governance token, COMP before the member is\nable to publish a proposal. The DAO also offers a Compound Autonomous Proposals\n[https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/42] (CAPs) which allows for\ncommunity members that don’t own a large amount of COMP to have a meaningful\npresence too. CAPs are mini proposals that only need to be voted on by a smaller\nnumber of members to pass. If the proposal passes it then becomes a normal\nproposal with the possibility of being executed if enough of the community votes\nfor it. Implementing innovative governance structures such as this is key in\nfacilitating growth of a DAO. \n\n\nVoting\n\nThe other essential function that a DAO governance platform needs to have is\nvoting. Voting structure can be up to the DAO team’s discretion using the\nstrategies that they think will facilitate the most engagement. Some DAO’s only\nallow token holders to vote and others allow anyone to vote. There are obvious\npros and cons to both approaches therefore whatever option that suits any given\nDAO is dependent on the core mission and values of that DAO. \n\n\nThe options and data that voters have at their disposal should stay consistent\nno matter who gets to vote. More options and available data for voters empowers\nthem to make more informed decisions in different ways. An option to give voters\nalong with the ‘for’ and ‘against’ vote is the abstain to vote option. This\nexpands the voting possibilities given to community members which will\ninevitably lead to increased voter turnout. Increased voter turnout is\nespecially important for DAOs that have a voting threshold that needs to be\npassed in order for a proposal to be executed. For each vote, an optional\ndiscussion string for the community member to give their reasoning behind the\nvote can be a powerful tool both for engagement KPIs and empowering other\nmembers to make informed voting decisions. \n\nFull transparency on all of the voting activities along with analytics\ndescribing these activities are needed to provide further information to\ncommunity members in order to allow them to make informed decisions. Here’s a\nnon-exhaustive list of what to present to community members:\n\n * Document every member that voted\n * Display the amount of members that voted\n * A live feed on how close the proposal is to being executed\n * How many community members voted for each voting option\n * A link to the profile of each voter \n   \n\nBounties\n\nA governance platform should have a bounty option for general maintenance (i.e.:\nbug fixes) and minor project requests. This mechanism is the most efficient way\nfor a community to request general upkeep tasks and minor improvements. \n\n\nHiring\n\nDAO governance platforms with full functionality have the ability to facilitate\nhiring using features specific to that use case and not just using a normal\ndiscussion thread. A hiring thread can be organized in a way that easily gives\nvoters access to the candidate's credentials, scope of work, past experience,\nand other important information that’s presented with a UI tailored to hiring.\n\n\n\nGrants & Collectives\n\nDAOs have increasingly been creating programs to facilitate the growth of their\nsurrounding ecosystem. This often means providing funding in various ways to\npromising projects that are based on the DAO. Programs like this have almost\nbecome essential in growing a DAO. Large protocols like Uniswap, Compound, and\nAave have recently set up large grant programs to grow the ecosystem surrounding\nthem and to incentivize more bug fixes. Requests for proposals or RFPs allow DAO\nteams to encourage grant proposals outlining ideas that the team or community\ndeems important for the DAO. \n\nCollectives are similar to grant programs but give the community control to use\nthe allocated resources to fund whatever they want. This shift in power to the\ncommunity allows for more use cases. Collective use cases include creating a\npower pool where interest from the tokens in the pool goes toward funding\nprojects, creating funds for social tokens, and creating investment clubs where\nmembers can vote on where to allocate capital. Collectives like this can be the\nbiggest program driving growth within a DAO. \n\n\n\nDiscussions\n\nGiving community members capabilities to discuss all of the above activities\nwithin the same thread that they are occurring in is crucial in organizing and\nfacilitating community engagement. Allowing discussion in a governance platform\nhas been essential for a while. Now its becoming essential that discussion be\norganized and able to occur anywhere on the forum. \n\nEvery governance forum should also enable discussion threads on them for the\nsake of easy communication on the platform. Having discussions like this in the\nsame place as governance activities are taking place may inform voters and allow\nthem to discuss topics before acting on them. \n\nIt can be a huge undertaking developing a governance platform with all the above\ncapabilities and consistently staying up to date with governance developments. \nCommonwealth [https://commonwealth.im/] is a governance platform for\ndecentralized communities that has all the capabilities mentioned in this blog\n(and more).\n\nThe mentioned characteristics of DAO governance are by no means the only\nfeatures that a DAO community needs to govern in a way that facilitates growth\nand innovation.
