The AMA session started with an\nintroduction from the CEO of Commonwealth Labs, Dillon Chen. \n\n\nDillon: \"I’m Dillon, founder of Commonwealth. I got into crypto in 2013, when I\ngot my first Bitcoin. From there, Commonwealth started in 2018, where our\nprojects have raised $20m. Our main focus now is that we’re building an\nintegrated multi chain-governance, discussions, and crowdfunding protocol called \nhttps://commonwealth.im. I’ve been a trader, investor, and dorm room miner in\ncrypto, really great to watch the whole industry grow.\n\n\nWould you like to share a bit more about Common Protocol and the partnership\nwith Crust Network?\nDillon: Yea! So we’re really excited to be integrating this great Crust\nCommunity into the Commonwealth Interface, as one of the premier Substrate\nProjects. Basically the Crust community will be able to have an integrated place\nto chat long form, vote on governance, and fund treasury proposals. You can see\nthe latest at https://commonwealth.im/crust , upon completion,  expect it to\nlook like this: https://commonwealth.im/hydradx \n\n\nYouan, can you briefly introduce Crust on your end? When were you established\nand what stage have you developed to now?\nYouan: Crust Network is a decentralized storage application developed based on\nthe Polkadot Substrate framework, we provide an incentive layer for IPFS storage\nnodes. Compared with many other blockchain applications, our functions are\neasier for everyone to understand. Everyone should have used various cloud\nproducts. Crust and these cloud products provide similar services. Users can use\nCrust to store their own files and communicate with others. Crust transfer\nfiles, our users can be individuals, companies, organizations.\n\nSo how are we different from traditional cloud vendors? Traditional cloud\nvendors have their own large centralized computer center to store data centrally\nfor users. Crust is more like a form of \"sharing economy\". We do not provide\nstorage space. The storage space is provided by Crust nodes. The Crust public\nchain builds a bridge between nodes and users, and is responsible for scheduling\nusers' storage orders to nodes. Then pay salaries to the nodes. As a result,\nusers' files are \"distributed\" and stored on nodes all over the world, rather\nthan being controlled centrally. In addition to security, distributed storage\ncan also bring users a lower price.\n\nOur team was established in 2018. After two years of development and testing,\nthe first phase of the test network was officially deployed on November 30 last\nyear. On February 4 this year, we launched the Maxwell preview network, which\nintegrates almost all functions of the future main network, including node\nmining and guarantor pledge. So far, the total capacity of Maxwell's entire\nnetwork has reached 638PB. A work progress that we are very proud of is that on\nFebruary 28, Crust officially opened the storage function, which means that all\nusers can now use Maxwell network storage and transfer their files.\n\nOur mainnet is expected to go live after the Polkadot slot is captured.\n\n\nBesides as a governance platform, how else would the Common Protocol be useful\nfor Crust?\nDillon: So, in general, as long as we've been in crypto, we’ve found it really\nhard for people to get involved in governance. This came up for multiple\nreasons:\n\n\n1) the conversation was fragmented across chat apps and more\n\n2) voting was a pain (and still is)\n\n3) information across all these protocols are spread across a few different\napplications\n\n\nWe bring everything together into one place, similar to a “crypto-Reddit” for\nevery single token community that you’re a part of. Even before projects get\nstarted, they can create a project, and then they can crowdfund directly thru\nthe interface\n\nBeyond the features named above, there’s some easy-to-use things in the\npipeline.\n\n\n1) on-chain and in app notification\n\n2) mobile app to stay updated with all notifications\n\n3) and the last plans for the Common Protocol to decentralize and allow people\nto run the platform.\n\n\nTldr we want to make the product itself into something people want to use every\nday, similar to Telegram or Twitter: if you want to hop in \nhttps://t.me/HiCommonwealth (just started) you can give us any product\nrecommendation for https://commonwealth.im.\n\n\nWhat are some practical examples of Crust storage? How do you plan to promote\nthe implementation of the application?\nYouan: I guess some audience may wonder, is Crust really as easy to use as I\nsaid? Is it really one of the few storage and useable applications on the\nstorage track? We borrowed from Filecoin to provide incentives for IPFS storage\nnodes, but chose a more efficient TEE proof method. At the same time, we also\nborrowed from Polkadot's NPOS economic model and added the role of guarantor. I\nwon’t repeat the specific details here. If you are interested, please follow us\non Twitter or join our community.\n\nSo what are the examples of Crust actually being utilized? Now, well-known\nprojects such as Uniswap, Sushiswap, Compound, and MakerDAO that you frequently\nvisit have begun to use Crust to deploy their own Dapp applications; the NFT\nassets you purchase may also be stored on the Crust network; you can use Decoo\n[https://decoo.io/](a file transfer application based on Crust netwok) to easily\nupload and share your files; you can also browse your favorite videos on Socbay\n[https://socbay.io/] (a video site based on Crust network).\n\nWe have also established Crust Grants to encourage developers to develop more\nfriendly and convenient To C applications based on the Crust storage layer. We\nwill give developers a reward of up to $30,000.\n\n\nIn fact, Crust has only opened storage functions for three months, but many\necological applications have already landed. Of course, we still need a lot of\npolishing, and we have been working hard toward evangelizing decentralized\nstorage.\n\n\nFinal question - can you give us a sneak peek of what events are coming up in\nCommon Protocol that we should be keeping an eye on?\n\n\nDillon: So we’re gonna be launching 3 major product releases over the next few\nmonths. \n\n1): self serve creation for forums\n\n2): full crowdfunding protocol\n\n3): and some cool swag ($ALLS, our equivalent of $SOCKS)\n\n\nYouan: Our \"Profit Data\" campaign will be officially launched on June 22. Users\nonly need to use Crust to store files, and the system will generate data\ncomputing power for the files. You can get CRU rewards by staking CSM on the\ndata computing power. Each TB of data computing power can pledge up to 10,000\nCSM. In this event, we will issue a total of 54,000 CRUs to users, and the event\nwill last for 180 days.\n\n\nSimilar to the GPOS economic model of the Maxwell network, the CSM is pledged\nfor data computing power. Users can pledge for themselves or help others to\nshare rewards.\n\nTo participate in this event, you first need to register a Crust Maxwell account\nto create a storage order. In addition, you also need to prepare about 0.1 CRU\nfor the cost of placing an order. We provide a certain amount of free storage\nspace, you only need to have a Github account registered for more than half a\nyear, and then apply through the official website\n[https://crustnetwork.medium.com/participate-in-crust-events-earn-csm-298b62db5b16]\n.\n\n\nThank you all for joining this AMA - make sure to join @hicommonwealth on\nTelegram here: https://t.me/HiCommonwealth and follow us on Twitter: \nhttps://twitter.com/hicommonwealth to stay up to date on everything we’re\nworking on, including a future token launch. :-)","html":"<p><em>Following the announcement of our exciting partnership with Crust Network, both communities tuned in for an exciting AMA session with Commonwealth Labs’ CEO Dillon Chen, and Crust Network’s Global Branding Head, Youan Zang. </em></p><p>This much anticipated AMA session was focused on the recent partnership between both communities – the start of a series of partnerships dedicated to expanding the Common Protocol ecosystem.<br></p><p>The partnership between both communities is summarized as follows: <em>\"Common Protocol will enrich the function of Crust community government,\" said Steve from Crust Networks, \"while Crust will provide storage solutions for the Off-Chain data storage feature.\"</em><br></p><p>Here's how it all went down on the 21st of June, hosted on the Crust Network Telegram group with over 45k members.

Now, well-known projects such as Uniswap, Sushiswap, Compound, and MakerDAO that you frequently visit have begun to use Crust to deploy their own Dapp applications; the NFT assets you purchase may also be stored on the Crust network; you can use <a href=\"https://decoo.io/\">Decoo </a>(a file transfer application based on Crust netwok) to easily upload and share your files; you can also browse your favorite videos on <a href=\"https://socbay.io/\">Socbay</a> (a video site based on Crust network).</p><p>We have also established Crust Grants to encourage developers to develop more friendly and convenient To C applications based on the Crust storage layer. We will give developers a reward of up to $30,000.<br></p><p>In fact, Crust has only opened storage functions for three months, but many ecological applications have already landed. Of course, we still need a lot of polishing, and we have been working hard toward evangelizing decentralized storage.<br></p><h3 id=\"final-questioncan-you-give-us-a-sneak-peek-of-what-events-are-coming-up-in-common-protocol-that-we-should-be-keeping-an-eye-on\"><em>Final question - can you give us a sneak peek of what events are coming up in Common Protocol that we should be keeping an eye on?</em></h3><p></p><p><strong>Dillon: </strong>So we’re gonna be launching 3 major product releases over the next few months. </p><p>1): self serve creation for forums</p><p>2): full crowdfunding protocol</p><p>3): and some cool swag ($ALLS, our equivalent of $SOCKS)<br></p><p><strong>Youan: </strong>Our \"Profit Data\" campaign will be officially launched on June 22. Users only need to use Crust to store files, and the system will generate data computing power for the files. You can get CRU rewards by staking CSM on the data computing power. Each TB of data computing power can pledge up to 10,000 CSM. In this event, we will issue a total of 54,000 CRUs to users, and the event will last for 180 days.<br></p><p>Similar to the GPOS economic model of the Maxwell network, the CSM is pledged for data computing power. Users can pledge for themselves or help others to share rewards.</p><p>To participate in this event, you first need to register a Crust Maxwell account to create a storage order. In addition, you also need to prepare about 0.1 CRU for the cost of placing an order. We provide a certain amount of free storage space, you only need to have a Github account registered for more than half a year, and then apply through the <a href=\"https://crustnetwork.medium.com/participate-in-crust-events-earn-csm-298b62db5b16\">official website</a>.<br></p><p><strong>Thank you all for joining this AMA - make sure to join @hicommonwealth on Telegram here: </strong><a href=\"https://t.me/HiCommonwealth\"><strong>https://t.me/HiCommonwealth</strong></a><strong>  and follow us on Twitter: </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hicommonwealth\"><strong>https://twitter.com/hicommonwealth</strong></a><strong>  to stay up to date on everything we’re working on, including a future token launch. :-)</strong></p>","url":"https://commonwealth.ghost.io/crust-common-ama-recap/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"4b9c60b6-fdb8-41ab-9a62-d381d9472793","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"60d28ec23a4b17003e7e1a48","reading_time":5}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__60c1018f161656003bb8733f","title":"What a DAO Governance Platform Needs in 2021","slug":"what-dao-governance-needs-in-2021","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://commonwealth.ghost.io/content/images/2021/06/DAO-governmance.png","excerpt":"DAOs have the potential to make meaningful contributions to society by aligning a community to strive towards a common goal.

DAO governance\nis constantly being innovated and developed further making it difficult to\nfigure out what functionalities work best for any given individual DAO. In this\narticle we will discuss what functionalities that a DAO’s governance platform\nneeds in 2021 to properly facilitate growth and innovation within its community. \n\n\nKey Functionalities\n\nThe functionality that the governance platform provides it’s community is one of\nthe most important aspects of a DAO. Giving a DAO’s community as much governance\ncapabilities as possible will facilitate more innovative ideas and growth\nopportunities from that community. The functionality of a DAO’s governance\nplatform can either facilitate growth opportunities by having full governance\ncapabilities or stunt growth by limiting the community with an incomplete or\nfragmented platform. \n\nOffering a complete governance platform to its community should be one of a\nDAO’s top priorities from the very beginning of its inception. Below are the\nqualities that make a DAO governance platform complete in 2021. \n\n\nProposal publishing\n\nOne of the necessities that a DAO needs to have is providing its community with\nthe ability to make proposals. The structure and process of how community\nmembers publish proposals is dependent on the makeup of the DAO that they are a\npart of. If a DAO has a large and active governance community, the best practice\nis to restrict proposal publishing privileges to members with a certain amount\nof governance token owned. If the DAO has a relatively small number of active\ncommunity members it is best to allow anyone to publish a proposal so as to not\nrestrict the little activity that is occurring.\n\nCompound DAO [https://compound.finance/governance] takes a somewhat hybrid\napproach with their innovative proposal structure that combines the positives\nfrom both of the aforementioned options. A community member is required to have\na significant amount of the Compound governance token, COMP before the member is\nable to publish a proposal. The DAO also offers a Compound Autonomous Proposals\n[https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/42] (CAPs) which allows for\ncommunity members that don’t own a large amount of COMP to have a meaningful\npresence too. CAPs are mini proposals that only need to be voted on by a smaller\nnumber of members to pass. If the proposal passes it then becomes a normal\nproposal with the possibility of being executed if enough of the community votes\nfor it. Implementing innovative governance structures such as this is key in\nfacilitating growth of a DAO. \n\n\nVoting\n\nThe other essential function that a DAO governance platform needs to have is\nvoting. Voting structure can be up to the DAO team’s discretion using the\nstrategies that they think will facilitate the most engagement. Some DAO’s only\nallow token holders to vote and others allow anyone to vote. There are obvious\npros and cons to both approaches therefore whatever option that suits any given\nDAO is dependent on the core mission and values of that DAO. \n\n\nThe options and data that voters have at their disposal should stay consistent\nno matter who gets to vote. More options and available data for voters empowers\nthem to make more informed decisions in different ways. An option to give voters\nalong with the ‘for’ and ‘against’ vote is the abstain to vote option. This\nexpands the voting possibilities given to community members which will\ninevitably lead to increased voter turnout. Increased voter turnout is\nespecially important for DAOs that have a voting threshold that needs to be\npassed in order for a proposal to be executed. For each vote, an optional\ndiscussion string for the community member to give their reasoning behind the\nvote can be a powerful tool both for engagement KPIs and empowering other\nmembers to make informed voting decisions. \n\nFull transparency on all of the voting activities along with analytics\ndescribing these activities are needed to provide further information to\ncommunity members in order to allow them to make informed decisions. Here’s a\nnon-exhaustive list of what to present to community members:\n\n * Document every member that voted\n * Display the amount of members that voted\n * A live feed on how close the proposal is to being executed\n * How many community members voted for each voting option\n * A link to the profile of each voter \n   \n\nBounties\n\nA governance platform should have a bounty option for general maintenance (i.e.:\nbug fixes) and minor project requests. This mechanism is the most efficient way\nfor a community to request general upkeep tasks and minor improvements. \n\n\nHiring\n\nDAO governance platforms with full functionality have the ability to facilitate\nhiring using features specific to that use case and not just using a normal\ndiscussion thread. A hiring thread can be organized in a way that easily gives\nvoters access to the candidate's credentials, scope of work, past experience,\nand other important information that’s presented with a UI tailored to hiring.\n\n\n\nGrants & Collectives\n\nDAOs have increasingly been creating programs to facilitate the growth of their\nsurrounding ecosystem. This often means providing funding in various ways to\npromising projects that are based on the DAO. Programs like this have almost\nbecome essential in growing a DAO. Large protocols like Uniswap, Compound, and\nAave have recently set up large grant programs to grow the ecosystem surrounding\nthem and to incentivize more bug fixes. Requests for proposals or RFPs allow DAO\nteams to encourage grant proposals outlining ideas that the team or community\ndeems important for the DAO. \n\nCollectives are similar to grant programs but give the community control to use\nthe allocated resources to fund whatever they want. This shift in power to the\ncommunity allows for more use cases. Collective use cases include creating a\npower pool where interest from the tokens in the pool goes toward funding\nprojects, creating funds for social tokens, and creating investment clubs where\nmembers can vote on where to allocate capital. Collectives like this can be the\nbiggest program driving growth within a DAO. \n\n\n\nDiscussions\n\nGiving community members capabilities to discuss all of the above activities\nwithin the same thread that they are occurring in is crucial in organizing and\nfacilitating community engagement. Allowing discussion in a governance platform\nhas been essential for a while. Now its becoming essential that discussion be\norganized and able to occur anywhere on the forum. \n\nEvery governance forum should also enable discussion threads on them for the\nsake of easy communication on the platform. Having discussions like this in the\nsame place as governance activities are taking place may inform voters and allow\nthem to discuss topics before acting on them. \n\nIt can be a huge undertaking developing a governance platform with all the above\ncapabilities and consistently staying up to date with governance developments. \nCommonwealth [https://commonwealth.im/] is a governance platform for\ndecentralized communities that has all the capabilities mentioned in this blog\n(and more).\n\nThe mentioned characteristics of DAO governance are by no means the only\nfeatures that a DAO community needs to govern in a way that facilitates growth\nand innovation.

One of the popular blockchain ideas is the use of decentralized autonomous organizations. This article will discuss what decentralized autonomous organizations actually are, the upsides and downsides of them, how they are being used today, and some potential future use cases. <br></p><p><strong>What is a DAO?</strong></p><p>A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (or DAO for short) is an organization run without the control of a central authority. Instead, DAOs leverage blockchain technology to execute a fully autonomous organization by replacing the central authority with community input. An example of a central authority is a stock exchange like the NYSE or a stock trading app like Robinhood. In a centralized organization like Robinhood, they have the power to potentially block or freeze the activities of their users. In a DAO this is not possible because a central authority holds no final say or decision making power.  This shift in control gives the community that is surrounding the organization the ability to make key decisions in governance and how the organization’s resources are managed. The decision making structure and processes are done by leveraging blockchain technology. Through the use of this tech, self-executing code is created in a fully transparent setting.
